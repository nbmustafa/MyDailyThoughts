Below is a complete and self-contained answer to your query about using Terraform's `null_resource` to manage Kubernetes secrets securely, avoiding storing sensitive data in the state file, while addressing the two specific questions: how to import an existing Kubernetes secret named `mysecret` and how to ensure Terraform detects changes on subsequent runs.

### Managing Kubernetes Secrets with Terraform's Null Resource

When using Terraform to manage Kubernetes secrets, a common concern is avoiding the storage of sensitive information (e.g., secret values) in the Terraform state file, as it could pose a security risk if not properly secured. The `null_resource` in Terraform provides a way to execute commands or scripts (e.g., via a `local-exec` provisioner) without inherently managing a stateful resource, making it a suitable choice for this scenario. Below, I’ll address your two questions step-by-step with a secure and practical solution.

#### 1. Importing an Existing Kubernetes Secret (`mysecret`) into Terraform Using `null_resource`

**Short Answer**: When using `null_resource`, you don’t "import" the existing secret in the traditional Terraform sense (e.g., via `terraform import`), because `null_resource` doesn’t manage the secret’s state directly. Instead, you configure the `null_resource` to recognize and work with the existing secret idempotently—ensuring it doesn’t recreate or overwrite `mysecret` unnecessarily.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Why Traditional Import Doesn’t Apply**: Typically, Terraform’s `terraform import` command is used to bring an existing resource under Terraform management by updating the state file with its current configuration. However, `null_resource` is a special resource that doesn’t correspond to a specific infrastructure object (like a Kubernetes secret). It’s a placeholder for executing provisioners, so there’s no state to import for the secret itself.
- **Solution**: Use a `local-exec` provisioner with a command that applies the desired secret configuration in an idempotent way. The `kubectl apply` command is ideal here because it creates the secret if it doesn’t exist or updates it if it does, without requiring an explicit import step.
- **Practical Approach**: Define the secret’s desired state in Terraform variables and use `kubectl apply` to synchronize the Kubernetes cluster with that state. If `mysecret` already exists, `kubectl apply` will only update it if the configuration differs.

**Example**: Suppose `mysecret` should contain key-value pairs like `key1=value1` and `key2=value2`. You can define this in Terraform and apply it as follows.

#### 2. Detecting Changes on Subsequent Terraform Runs

**Short Answer**: Use the `triggers` attribute in the `null_resource` with a hash of the secret data. This ensures the provisioner re-runs only when the secret data changes in Terraform, updating `mysecret` accordingly, while keeping sensitive data out of the state file.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Why Change Detection is Challenging**: Since `null_resource` doesn’t track the state of the Kubernetes secret (e.g., its current values in the cluster), Terraform won’t inherently know if `mysecret` has changed outside of Terraform (e.g., via `kubectl edit`). However, we can configure it to enforce the desired state based on changes in the Terraform configuration.
- **Solution**: Use the `triggers` attribute to monitor changes in the secret data defined in Terraform. By computing a hash of the secret data and including it in `triggers`, Terraform will re-execute the provisioner whenever the hash changes (i.e., when the secret data in Terraform changes).
- **Security Consideration**: To avoid storing sensitive data in the state file, the `triggers` value should be a hash (e.g., SHA256) of the secret data, not the data itself. This ensures that only a non-reversible checksum is stored, maintaining security.
- **Limitation**: This approach detects changes in the Terraform-defined secret data, not external changes to `mysecret` in Kubernetes. If external drift detection is needed, additional tools or processes (e.g., a drift detection script) would be required, but this would likely involve fetching secret data, which we’re avoiding for security reasons.

**Example**: Use a variable for secret data, hash it for the trigger, and apply the secret with `kubectl`.

#### Complete Solution

Here’s a Terraform configuration that addresses both requirements:

```hcl
# Define secret data as a sensitive variable
variable "secret_data" {
  description = "A map of key-value pairs for the secret data"
  type        = map(string)
  sensitive   = true
  default     = {
    "key1" = "value1"
    "key2" = "value2"
  }
}

# Null resource to manage the Kubernetes secret
resource "null_resource" "create_secret" {
  # Trigger the provisioner only when the secret data changes
  triggers = {
    secret_hash = sha256(jsonencode(var.secret_data))
  }

  # Use local-exec to apply the secret idempotently
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOF
cat <<EOT | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
  ${join("\n  ", [for k, v in var.secret_data' = base64encode(v)}"])}
EOT
EOF
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Variable**: `secret_data` holds the key-value pairs for `mysecret`. The `sensitive` attribute ensures it’s masked in logs and outputs.
- **Triggers**: The `secret_hash` is a SHA256 hash of the JSON-encoded `secret_data`. If `secret_data` changes, the hash changes, triggering the provisioner.
- **Provisioner**: Generates a Kubernetes Secret manifest with base64-encoded data (as required by Kubernetes) and applies it using `kubectl apply`. This ensures `mysecret` is created if missing or updated if it exists but differs.

#### How It Works
1. **Importing `mysecret`**:
   - If `mysecret` already exists in Kubernetes, `kubectl apply` will compare its current state with the Terraform-defined state. If they match, no action is taken; if they differ, it updates `mysecret`. No explicit import is needed since `null_resource` doesn’t manage state directly.
2. **Change Detection**:
   - On subsequent runs, Terraform checks the `secret_hash` in the state file. If it differs from the current hash of `var.secret_data`, the provisioner runs, updating `mysecret`. The state file stores only the hash, not the secret values, ensuring security.

#### Security Notes
- The state file contains `secret_hash`, a one-way hash, not the secret data itself. This prevents exposure of sensitive information.
- Use Terraform’s sensitive variables or external secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to further secure `var.secret_data` if it’s sourced from outside Terraform.

#### Limitations
- **External Changes**: This setup won’t detect changes to `mysecret` made outside Terraform (e.g., via `kubectl`). To enforce Terraform’s desired state, re-run `terraform apply`. For full drift detection, you’d need to fetch the secret’s state, which risks storing sensitive data in Terraform—contrary to your goal.
- **Special Characters**: The YAML generation assumes keys and values in `secret_data` are simple strings. For complex values, test the `base64encode` and `kubectl apply` behavior to ensure compatibility.

This approach provides a secure, idempotent way to manage `mysecret` with Terraform’s `null_resource`, avoiding sensitive data in the state file while handling existing secrets and detecting configuration changes effectively.
