You’re absolutely right to call this out — the registry_login block I previously suggested doesn’t actually exist in the Terraform Helm provider. Thanks for prompting a second look!

What the Helm Provider Actually Supports

Reviewing the official Terraform documentation and community examples, here’s how it handles OCI registries:

Provider configuration supports a registries block (formerly registry in older versions). This isn't a dynamic login but requires static credentials:

provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    config_path = "~/.kube/config"
  }

  registries = [
    {
      url      = "oci://private.registry"
      username = "username"
      password = "password"
    }
  ]
}

This is confirmed by both the Helm docs and HashiCorp’s Helm provider upgrade guide, which details the shift to registries list blocks for Terraform Plugin Framework versions .

No built-in dynamic login mechanism such as registry_login exists. Attempts to rely solely on Terraform for ECR OCI auth have been problematic, as illustrated in GitHub issue discussions. Users resort to workaround patterns like null_resource invoking helm registry login via local-exec, often using AWS ECR authorization tokens .

Recommended Pattern for Dynamic ECR Login

Since Terraform doesn't support dynamic registry login out-of-the-box, here's a robust workaround:

data "aws_ecr_authorization_token" "token" {}

resource "null_resource" "helm_login" {
  triggers = {
    always_run = timestamp()
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<-EOT
      HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1 \
      helm registry login \
        --username ${data.aws_ecr_authorization_token.token.user_name} \
        --password ${data.aws_ecr_authorization_token.token.password} \
        ${data.aws_ecr_authorization_token.token.proxy_endpoint}
    EOT
  }
}

resource "helm_release" "my_app" {
  depends_on = [null_resource.helm_login]

  name       = "my-app"
  repository = "oci://${chomp(data.aws_ecr_authorization_token.token.proxy_endpoint)}/helm-charts"
  chart      = "my-chart"
  version    = "1.2.3"
  namespace  = "default"
}

This uses Terraform's AWS provider to fetch the ECR token.

The null_resource ensures Helm OCI registry is logged in right before pulling the chart.

helm_release depends on this, ensuring reliable authentication.


This pattern aligns with real-world experiences and community practices when integrating Helm with ECR .

Summary Table

Feature	Supported?	Notes

registry_login block	No	Not in Terraform Helm provider schema.
registries block	Yes	Requires static username/password for each registry. 
Dynamic ECR helm login	No	Must use external shell (e.g., helm registry login) workaround. 



---

Takeaway

My earlier suggestion about registry_login was inaccurate—sorry for that oversight.

The provider only supports static credentials via registries.

For dynamic ECR access, the most reliable way in Terraform remains via null_resource + local-exec to run helm registry login, possibly using AWS-provided tokens.
