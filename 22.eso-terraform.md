To migrate the External Secrets Operator from a Kubernetes YAML-based deployment to Terraform, we'll use Terraform's Helm provider. This approach is recommended because the operator has an official Helm chart, making the deployment more declarative, idempotent, and easier to manage/version compared to converting raw YAML manifests into Terraform's `kubernetes_manifest` resources (which can be brittle for complex operators).

### Prerequisites
- A running Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl` access configured (e.g., via `~/.kube/config`).
- Terraform installed (version 1.0+).
- Helm provider configured in Terraform (it relies on Kubernetes access).
- Ensure all existing ExternalSecret, SecretStore, and ClusterSecretStore resources are deleted before uninstalling the old deployment to avoid issues with CRDs. Check with: `kubectl get ExternalSecrets,SecretStores,ClusterSecretStores --all-namespaces`. Delete them if present.
- Uninstall the existing YAML-based deployment (e.g., `kubectl delete -f your-manifests.yaml`) after backing up any custom configurations.
- If you have custom settings in your YAML (e.g., resource limits, namespaces), translate them to Helm values in the Terraform config below.

### Migration Steps
1. **Initialize a Terraform project**: Create a new directory, add the files below, and run `terraform init`.
2. **Review and customize**: Adjust the Helm values if your original YAML had non-default configs (e.g., via `values` block). Refer to the official chart values for options: search for "external-secrets helm chart values" or browse the chart repo.
3. **Apply the deployment**: Run `terraform apply`. This will deploy the operator via Helm.
4. **Verify**: Check pods with `kubectl get pods -n external-secrets`. Re-apply any CRs (e.g., SecretStores) as needed.
5. **Ongoing management**: Use Terraform for updates (e.g., version changes) and Git for version control.

### Terraform Configuration
Create `main.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    helm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/helm"
      version = "~> 2.15"
    }
    kubernetes = {
      source  = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
      version = "~> 2.32"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Kubernetes provider (adjust based on your cluster access method)
provider "kubernetes" {
  config_path = "~/.kube/config"  # Or use host, token, etc., for cloud-managed clusters like EKS/GKE/AKS
}

# Configure the Helm provider to use the Kubernetes connection
provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    config_path = "~/.kube/config"  # Match this to your kubernetes provider config
  }
}

# Optional: Explicitly create the namespace if you want more control
resource "kubernetes_namespace" "external_secrets" {
  metadata {
    name = "external-secrets"
  }
}

# Deploy External Secrets Operator via Helm
resource "helm_release" "external_secrets" {
  name       = "external-secrets"
  repository = "https://charts.external-secrets.io"
  chart      = "external-secrets"
  namespace  = kubernetes_namespace.external_secrets.metadata[0].name
  version    = "0.10.2"  # Use the latest stable version; check https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/releases for updates (e.g., 0.19.2 if available in 2025)

  # Enable CRD installation (important for operators)
  set {
    name  = "installCRDs"
    value = "true"
  }

  # Add custom values here if needed (e.g., from your original YAML)
  # Example: resource limits
  # set {
  #   name  = "resources.limits.cpu"
  #   value = "500m"
  # }
  # set {
  #   name  = "resources.limits.memory"
  #   value = "512Mi"
  # }

  # If using a values file, use:
  # values = [file("values.yaml")]

  depends_on = [kubernetes_namespace.external_secrets]
}
```

Create `outputs.tf` (optional, for verification):

```hcl
output "external_secrets_release_name" {
  value = helm_release.external_secrets.name
}

output "external_secrets_namespace" {
  value = helm_release.external_secrets.namespace
}
```

### Notes
- **Versioning**: The Helm chart version (e.g., 0.10.2) corresponds to the operator version. Pin to a specific version for stability; update as needed. If a newer version like 0.19.2 is available (based on recent releases), substitute it.
- **Customizations**: If your YAML deployment had overrides (e.g., different replica counts, service accounts), map them to Helm values in the `set` blocks. View default values by running `helm show values external-secrets/external-secrets --repo https://charts.external-secrets.io`.
- **Provider-Specific Setup**: If using AWS Secrets Manager or similar, configure a SecretStore CR after deployment (not part of the operator install). For cloud clusters (e.g., EKS), add IAM roles if needed, as in the example blog post.
- **Downtime Consideration**: The operator reconciles secrets periodically. During migration, secrets managed by ExternalSecrets may briefly be out of sync until the new operator is running.
- **Alternatives**: If you prefer not to use Helm, you could use Terraform's `kubernetes_manifest` to apply the YAML directly, but this is less maintainable for operators with many resources/CRDs.
- **Testing**: In a non-prod environment, test the migration by deploying to a separate namespace first.

If you provide your existing YAML manifests or specific customizations, I can refine this further.
