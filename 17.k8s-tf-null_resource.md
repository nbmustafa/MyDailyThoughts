To deploy Kubernetes resources from a Kubernetes manifest YAML file using Terraform null resources, you can utilize Terraform's `null_resource` combined with the `local-exec` provisioner to execute the `kubectl apply` command. This approach allows you to apply the manifest file to an existing Kubernetes cluster while ensuring that the deployment only occurs when the manifest changes. Below is a complete, step-by-step solution.

---

### Prerequisites
- A Kubernetes cluster is already set up and accessible.
- `kubectl` is installed on the machine running Terraform and configured to connect to the cluster (e.g., via a kubeconfig file or default context).
- The Kubernetes manifest YAML file (e.g., `manifest.yaml`) exists and contains valid resource definitions.

---

### Solution

#### 1. Define a Variable for the Manifest File
To make the configuration flexible, define a Terraform variable for the path to the manifest file. This allows you to easily change the file path without modifying the Terraform code.

```hcl
variable "manifest_file" {
  type    = string
  default = "./manifest.yaml"
  description = "Path to the Kubernetes manifest YAML file"
}
```

- **`type = string`**: Specifies that the variable is a string.
- **`default = "./manifest.yaml"`**: Sets a default path, assuming the manifest is in the same directory as your Terraform files.
- **`description`**: Provides clarity on the variable's purpose.

#### 2. Create a Null Resource with a Local-Exec Provisioner
Use a `null_resource` to execute the `kubectl apply` command. The `local-exec` provisioner runs the command on the machine where Terraform is executed.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "deploy_k8s" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "kubectl apply -f ${var.manifest_file}"
  }
}
```

- **`null_resource "deploy_k8s"`**: A placeholder resource that doesn’t manage infrastructure but triggers the provisioner.
- **`provisioner "local-exec"`**: Executes the specified command locally.
- **`command = "kubectl apply -f ${var.manifest_file}"`**: Runs `kubectl apply` with the manifest file path from the variable.

#### 3. Add a Trigger for Idempotency
To ensure the `kubectl apply` command only runs when the manifest file changes, add a `triggers` block using the `filemd5` function to compute the file’s hash.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "deploy_k8s" {
  triggers = {
    manifest_sha = filemd5(var.manifest_file)
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "kubectl apply -f ${var.manifest_file}"
  }
}
```

- **`triggers`**: Defines conditions that cause the resource to be re-evaluated.
- **`manifest_sha = filemd5(var.manifest_file)`**: Computes the MD5 hash of the manifest file. If the hash changes (i.e., the file is modified), Terraform re-runs the provisioner.

#### 4. (Optional) Specify Kubernetes Context
If your `kubectl` configuration requires a specific kubeconfig file or environment setup, you can add an `environment` block to the provisioner:

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "deploy_k8s" {
  triggers = {
    manifest_sha = filemd5(var.manifest_file)
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "kubectl apply -f ${var.manifest_file}"
    environment = {
      KUBECONFIG = "/path/to/kubeconfig"
    }
  }
}
```

- **`environment`**: Sets environment variables for the command.
- **`KUBECONFIG`**: Specifies the path to the kubeconfig file if not using the default.

### Complete Terraform Code
Here’s the full Terraform configuration:

```hcl
# Variable for the manifest file path
variable "manifest_file" {
  type    = string
  default = "./manifest.yaml"
  description = "Path to the Kubernetes manifest YAML file"
}

# Null resource to deploy Kubernetes resources
resource "null_resource" "deploy_k8s" {
  triggers = {
    manifest_sha = filemd5(var.manifest_file)
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "kubectl apply -f ${var.manifest_file}"
  }
}
```

---

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
2. **Apply**: Run `terraform apply`. Terraform:
   - Checks the MD5 hash of the manifest file.
   - If the hash differs from the previous state (or it’s the first run), executes `kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml`.
   - Updates the state with the new hash.
3. **Subsequent Applies**: If the manifest file hasn’t changed, the trigger value remains the same, and Terraform skips the provisioner, ensuring idempotency.

---

### Notes
- **Idempotency**: The `triggers` block ensures the command only runs when necessary. `kubectl apply` itself is idempotent, creating or updating resources as needed.
- **State Management**: The `null_resource` doesn’t track the Kubernetes resources’ state. Destroying the Terraform configuration (`terraform destroy`) removes the null resource from the state but leaves the Kubernetes resources intact.
- **Error Handling**: If `kubectl apply` fails (e.g., due to a missing file or cluster connectivity issues), Terraform marks the resource as tainted and retries on the next apply.
- **Multiple Manifests**: For multiple files, modify the variable to a list and use `for_each`:

```hcl
variable "manifest_files" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["./manifest1.yaml", "./manifest2.yaml"]
}

resource "null_resource" "deploy_k8s" {
  for_each = toset(var.manifest_files)

  triggers = {
    manifest_sha = filemd5(each.key)
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "kubectl apply -f ${each.key}"
  }
}
```

---

### Usage
1. Save the code in a `.tf` file (e.g., `main.tf`).
2. Place your `manifest.yaml` in the specified path (e.g., same directory as `main.tf`).
3. Run:
   - `terraform init`
   - `terraform apply`

This will deploy the Kubernetes resources defined in your manifest file using Terraform null resources. Adjust the `manifest_file` variable or add environment settings as needed for your environment.
