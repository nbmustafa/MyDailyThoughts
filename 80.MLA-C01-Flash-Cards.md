# üìò Machine Learning & AWS AI/ML Glossary

This README provides definitions, concepts, AWS services, and ML techniques that are commonly referenced in machine learning engineering, MLOps, and generative AI.

## üß± Core Concepts

* **Feature Engineering:** Involves the extraction and transformation of variables from raw data, such as price lists, product descriptions, and sales volumes so that you can use features for training and prediction.
* **Model Feature:** An input that machine learning (ML) models use during training and inference to make predictions.
* **MLOps:** A set of practices that automate and simplify machine learning (ML) workflows and deployments.
* **Overfitting:** An undesirable machine learning behavior that occurs when the machine learning model gives accurate predictions for training data but not for new data.
* **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** A machine learning (ML) technique that uses human feedback to optimize ML models to self-learn more efficiently.
* **Simple Model:** A ML model that produces faster and easy to explain results but may not be accurate.
* **Complex Model:** A ML model that produces accurate results but may be difficult to explain.

## ü§ñ Generative AI & LLMs

* **Amazon Bedrock:** A fully managed service that provides leading foundation models (FMs) and a set of features for rapidly developing and scaling generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.
* **Foundation Models (FMs):** A type of generative artificial intelligence (AI). They produce human language instructions in response to one or more inputs (prompts).
* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** A technique for improving the quality and reliability of generative AI models by obtaining facts from external sources.
* **Amazon Titan Text G1 - Express:** An extensive language model designed for text generation. It is suitable for a variety of complex, general language applications, including open-ended text generation and conversational chat, as well as support for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
* **Stop Sequences:** A sequence of characters. If the model finds a stop sequence, it will cease creating new tokens. Different models accept different sorts of characters in a stop sequence, as well as varied maximum sequence lengths. They may also permit the creation of numerous stop sequences.
* **Text-to-Text Models:** Large language models (LLMs) that have been trained to interpret massive amounts of textual data and human language.
* **Prompt Engineering:** An emerging field that focuses on developing, designing, and optimizing prompts to enhance the output of LLMs for your needs.

    * Sequence to Vector ‚Üí great for sentiment analysis (e.g., Tweet ‚Üí Sentiment).
    * Vector to Sequence ‚Üí ideal for image captioning (e.g., Image ‚Üí Caption).
* **Transformer:** A deep-learning architecture that includes an encoder component that converts input text to embeddings.
* **Text-to-Image Models:** Accept natural language input and generate a high-quality image that corresponds to the supplied text description.

  * Examples: *DALL¬∑E 2 (OpenAI), Imagen (Google), Stable Diffusion (Stability AI), Midjourney.*
* **Diffusion Architecture:** A deep learning architecture that learns through a two-step process: forward diffusion and reverse diffusion.
