To resolve the CoreDNS addon degraded status in your EKS cluster deployed via the Terraform AWS module, follow these steps:

1. Verify Subnet Tags

Ensure all subnets (public and private) are correctly tagged for EKS:

```hcl
   tags = {
     "kubernetes.io/role/elb"              = 1        # Public subnets
     "kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb"     = 1        # Private subnets
     "kubernetes.io/cluster/<CLUSTER_NAME>" = "shared" # Replace <CLUSTER_NAME>
   }
```

Incorrect tags prevent CoreDNS pods from accessing AWS services.

2. Check CoreDNS Deployment

Verify CoreDNS pod status and logs:

```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
   kubectl logs -n kube-system <coredns-pod-name>
```

Look for errors like network timeouts or permission issues.

3. Validate IAM Permissions

Ensure the EKS cluster role has required permissions for CoreDNS:

· eks:DescribeCluster
· ec2:DescribeInstances
· Attach the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to the node IAM roles if missing.

4. Update CoreDNS Configuration

If using custom configuration_values, ensure they are valid JSON. Example:

```hcl
   resource "aws_eks_addon" "coredns" {
     cluster_name      = aws_eks_cluster.main.name
     addon_name        = "coredns"
     addon_version     = "v1.10.1-eksbuild.4" # Match your EKS version
     resolve_conflicts = "OVERWRITE"
   }
```

5. Restart CoreDNS Pods

Delete CoreDNS pods to force restart:

```bash
   kubectl delete pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
```

6. Check Security Groups

Ensure node security groups allow DNS traffic (TCP/UDP port 53) within the VPC.

7. Verify Kubernetes Network

Confirm the CNI (e.g., AWS VPC CNI) is healthy:

```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=aws-node
```

8. Use Terraform to Recreate Addon

Taint the CoreDNS addon resource to force recreation:

```bash
   terraform taint aws_eks_addon.coredns
   terraform apply
```

9. Inspect EKS Addon Status

Check addon status via AWS CLI:

```bash
   aws eks describe-addon --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> --addon-name coredns
```

Common Fixes Summary:

· Subnet Tags: Missing kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb on private subnets.
· IAM Roles: Attach AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy to node roles.
· Resource Conflicts: Use resolve_conflicts = "OVERWRITE" in aws_eks_addon.
· Version Mismatch: Ensure CoreDNS addon version is compatible with your EKS version.

After applying these changes, monitor the CoreDNS pods until they transition to the Running state.

eks coredns addons in degraded status when deployin from eks terraform public module

When deploying EKS clusters using the Terraform public module, **CoreDNS addons often show a "degraded" status** due to resource and dependency issues during initial provisioning[1][2][3].

## Causes of Degraded Status

- **Race Condition**: The "degraded" status frequently occurs if the CoreDNS addon is created before the worker node group (which CoreDNS requires to run)[1]. This timing mismatch means the pods cannot be scheduled, causing Terraform to fail or timeout until the underlying resources stabilize[2][3].
- **Node Group Tolerations**: If all nodes are tainted, CoreDNS cannot schedule pods unless tolerations are configured. Even after patching deployments, the EKS console may keep reporting "degraded" status during rolling redeployments[2][4].
- **Permissions and Networking**: Insufficient node IAM permissions or lack of outbound network access also commonly result in addon failures, including the degraded status for CoreDNS[5].

## Recommended Solutions

- **Enforce Creation Order**: Ensure that the node groups are created before the CoreDNS addon by splitting Terraform resources or applying explicit dependencies in the configuration[1][6].
- **Set Tolerations and Configuration**: Use the `configuration_values` block in the addon declaration to specify tolerations, autoscaling settings, and Corefile overrides directly in the module[7][4].
- **Manual Patching**: As a workaround, patch the CoreDNS deployment manually after initial provisioning to apply the necessary tolerations and allow scheduling, but this can be tedious[2][4].
- **Check Permissions and Network**: Validate node roles and network connectivity, as these are common root causes for "degraded" CoreDNS status[5].

## Example Terraform Configuration

```hcl
addons = {
  coredns = {
    addon_version = "v1.11.4-eksbuild.2"
    most_recent = true
    configuration_values = <<EOT
    {
      "corefile": "...your config...",
      "autoScaling": {
        "enabled": true,
        "minReplicas": 2,
        "maxReplicas": 6
      },
      "tolerations": [
        {
          "key": "CriticalAddonsOnly",
          "effect": "NoSchedule",
          "operator": "Exists"
        }
      ]
    }
    EOT
  }
}
```


## Key Actions

- Confirm node groups exist before applying addons[1][3].
- Configure tolerations and autoscaling for CoreDNS[7][4].
- Check permissions and network access for nodes[5].

Following these steps helps stabilize EKS deployments and resolves frequent "degraded" statuses for the CoreDNS addon using the Terraform AWS module[7][1][5].
